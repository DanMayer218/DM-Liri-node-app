LIRI app

Welcome to liri, the all in one app for movies, concerts, spotifying songs and more.  Now from the comfort of your Command Line Interface you can have the convenience of all these services.  Liri was made using several api's from
- spotify
- bands in town api
and
- omdb.

Depending on your prompt (see below) the app will send a request from one of the sites above, parse the returned data and console log your requested information.

To use the app:

-Clone the repo from github

-Open your terminal and git clone it into the directory you want

-Once cloned, you can initiate the app by typing "node liri". followed by one of the following commands

-movie-this (then enter the movie name you want info on)
-spotify-this (then enter the song you want info on)
or
-concert-this (then enter the concert or artist you want info on)

Hope you find this app to be useful and I appreciate your interest,

Thank you, 

Daniel Mayer
